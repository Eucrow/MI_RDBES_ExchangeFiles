# MI_RDBES_ExchangeFiles
Functions to create and read exchange files for the RDBES database.
* Please use CreateExchangeFiles.R as an example of how to use the main functions.
* A stripped down example of how to create an exchange file is also available in WriteExchangeFileExample_WKRDBEST2.R
* A stripped down example of how to read an exchange file is also available in ReadExchangeFileExample_WKRDBEST2.R
* Other miscellaneous RDBES functions and scripts have been added to this repo in a slightly hap-hazard way...
